Humanâ€™s Thoughts and actions are realized through the workings of the nervous system centered on the brain. For example, when we move our bodies, motor commands from the brain are transmitted to our skeletal muscles through nerves, and the muscles then contract to execute the commands. During this process, the brain generates electrical signals called electroencephalograms (EEG), and the muscles generate electrical signals called electromyogram (EMG). Such electrical signals emitted from the human body are called biological signals, and their characteristics change depending on our cognition, thoughts, and actions. Therefore, if we could analyze biological signals and extract latent properties and information from them, it may lead to a wide range of applications, including not only the elucidation of biological functions but also the early detection of signs of diseases and disorders, and the realization of human-machine interfaces (HMI) that can be operated as the operator desires.
