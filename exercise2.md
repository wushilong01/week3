Today, information infrastructure technologies such as computers, the Internet, and cell phones are rapidly being developed, and the application fields of information technology are becoming increasingly complex and diverse. However, there are still many applications that can only be automated in a very limited way due to the bottleneck of not being able to realize information processing functions that are "easy for humans but difficult for current computers," such as recognition, learning, situation-based judgment, attention, meaning comprehension, and summarization. For example, human vision can easily find a person's face even under very poor conditions or drive a car in very bad weather, but current computer vision has not yet achieved the same level of performance as humans. Facial recognition has finally been built into digital cameras recently, but it has not yet reached the point where a general-purpose vision system can be built into a variety of devices and used, such as a car that drives itself. Brain science, on the other hand, is recognized as one of the most important remaining frontier science research subjects in the 21st century and is the subject of vigorous research and development around the world. As a result, the operating principles of information processing in the brain are gradually being clarified. To develop information processing that is "easy for humans but difficult for current computers" by incorporating such brain science findings, challenging research that integrates brain science and information science is necessary.
